Parts are: M970 XTR wheels, brakes, cranks , disks, cassette, freehub, and 9 speed XO shifters and derailleur. Thompson seat post, Specialized Phenom titanium railed seat, and S-works carbon bar. Fork is Fox RLC, shock is Fox Float RP23. Cosmetically the clear coat is peeling. The Drive train will need to be replaced. Your choice: keep it high end and light or just throw some cheap SLX on there and this bike has lots of life left in it.

This bike has been well ridden and well maintained. Anyone who tells you that weight is not important hasn't ridden an IBIS. It is quick, nimble, and easy to carry. Parts are: M970 XTR wheels, brakes, cranks , disks, cassette, freehub, and 9 speed XO shifters and derailleur. Thompson seat post, Specialized Phenom titanium railed seat, and S-works carbon bar. Fork is Fox RLC, shock is Fox Float RP23. Cosmetically the clear coat is peeling. The Drive train will need to be replaced. Your choice: keep it high end and light or just throw some cheap SLX on there and this bike has lots of life left in it. I still ride it whenever my current bike is in the shop and it's tonnes of fun. Yours for a decent offer."
