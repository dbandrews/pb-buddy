The frame has been protected with Invisiframe vinyl protection ($150 value) to keep the finish free of scratches and looking new. The wheels, tires, rotors, and stem are like-new, with one\/two test rides on them. The drivetrain shows some cosmetic signs of wear, but functions perfectly. The hightower is an extremely capable and versatile trail\/all-mountain\/enduro chasis and can even be very easily converted to 29\" wheels.
